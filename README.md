# Clojure Introduction

In this workshop, we create a game which combines simple rules to
create complexity.  Modelled on life, this game's rules were inspired by
[birth, death and
survival](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdMzngWchDk).

This repo contains:

- a starter-kit for programming the [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
- examples which you can mold to your ends.



## Install

- `git clone git@github.com:adcloud/clojure-intro-workshop.git`
- Install [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/).
- Somewhere under the project folder, run `lein deps`
- You can start an interactive repl with `lein repl`
